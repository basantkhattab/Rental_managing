Interim report 1
The project has had a slower start than expected. I was having trouble with the version control in the
beginning and was unable to push anything, but now it is working well.
All planned classes have been created and methods planned out.
Item class method getPrice done (not tested).
RentalManager class all methods done (not tested).
Having trouble with the AccountingManager class but hopefully the methods will be done within a few days
I have worked around 15 hours on the project so far mainly researching and relearning things I don't remember
The project is slightly behind schedule since it was difficult to get started but my pace is becoming faster.

Interim report 2
All of the classes are finished to some extent, there will still be changes as I haven't really tested much
but I am at a phase where I can start working on the GUI and testing as I go. I have tried to do work on the file
management but I am not sure if it works properly. I'm having a bit of trouble with the GUI as I haven't used
scala FX before and the resources are limited. In the past weeks I have used around 30 hours on the project mainly
researching how scala FX and file management works and trying to implement small things.
Hopefully within the next couple of weeks I will finish the GUI so that I can proceed with more in detail testing
and finalizing the project.


Interim report 3
Been working on the GUI for the past couple weeks. It has been very slow since I got stuck all the time. At this point
I'm a bit worried I won't have enough time to finish the project but I am trying to pick up the pace. I think I have finally
picked up a good flow with the GUI and it is starting to come together. I have spent around 30 hours again these past few weeks
although I think I should've probably worked more on it. The next few weeks are not as busy for me so I will be using a lot
more time on the project

The project has had a slower start than expected. I was having trouble with the version control in the
beginning and was unable to push anything, but now it is working well.
All planned classes have been created and methods planned out.
Item class method getPrice done (not tested).
RentalManager class all methods done (not tested).
Having trouble with the AccountingManager class but hopefully the methods will be done within a few days
I have worked around 15 hours on the project so far mainly researching and relearning things I don't remember
The project is slightly behind schedule since it was difficult to get started but my pace is becoming faster.
